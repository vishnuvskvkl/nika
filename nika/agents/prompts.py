- The user's question: {question}
- The database schema (table names, column names, data types, relationships between tables, etc.): {database_schema}

- If the user's question can be handled by a single SQL query, generate a single step with "agent": "query_builder".
- If multiple steps are needed for complex query generation, provide the steps accordingly.
- If any data science-related task is involved, use "agent": "data_science". However, do not use "data_science" agent for simple aggregations or operations that can be achieved by constructing a SQL query.
- Be as specific as possible in your step-by-step instructions.
- Assume that other agents or components will execute your instructions exactly as written.
